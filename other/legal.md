### Who can access the data?
#### The following people can access the data (prefixes,  command logging, server-wide blacklists, and global bot blacklists):
##### • Bot Administrators

### Why does it store the data?
#### It stores server IDs & channel IDs for settings because:
##### • Without those most of the bot would not be functional. The logs would break or would not properly log commands in the set channel.
#### It stores user IDs for server-wide & global blacklists because:
##### • Without those the bot would be unable to detect blacklisted users.

### How can I request for my data to be removed?
