## Introducing slash commands to Emojifier
What are slash commands? Slash commands are a new way to use bot commands - directly integrated into the Discord client for a better user experience.

## Interested in testing them out?
Great! Just invite Emojifier to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089&scope=bot+applications.commands) and you'll see them appear when you type `/`.
