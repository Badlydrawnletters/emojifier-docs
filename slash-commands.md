## Introducing slash commands to Emojifier
What are slash commands? Slash commands are a new way to use bot commands - directly integrated into the Discord client for a better user experience.

## Interested in testing them out?
If you’re interested in testing them out in your server and Emojifier was already added before March 25th of this year, no action is required. Just type / in your server and you’ll see Emojifier’s slash commands auto-magically appear. 

However, if Emojifier’s not already in your server/wasn't added before the 25th no worries! You can invite the bot using this invite link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089&scope=bot+applications.commands.

?> If you have any issues using our slash commands, please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/MTwj6wG) to receive assistance!
