## Introducing user app support to Emojifier
What is a user app? When you add a user app to your account, it becomes available for use across all your servers, direct messages, and group DMs. This means you can enjoy Emojifier on any Discord server you're part of, without needing permission from a server admin to add the bot. Plus, you can use it in direct messages and group chats with your friends.

## Interested in testing them out?
Great! Just install Emojifier to your account with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089) then select "Add to My Apps". After you've installed it to your account and you'll see them appear when you type `/` even if the server doesn't have Emojifier added to it. Also, you can use Emojifier commands in direct messages and group chats!
