## Introducing user app support to Emojifier
What is a user app? This means you can enjoy Emojifier across all your Discord servers without needing a server admin to add the bot. Also, you can use it in direct messages and group chats with friends.

## Interested in testing them out?
Great! Just install Emojifier to your account with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089) then select "Add to My Apps". After you've installed it to your account and you'll see them appear when you type `/` even if the server doesn't have Emojifier added to it. Also, you can use Emojifier commands in direct messages and group chats!
