### Description
This command is used to convert text into badly drawn letter emojis
### Usage
```
!!convert <text>
```
### Permission Required
Anyone can use this command, unless they are blacklisted globally
?> All **Usage** sections on these docs will assume that the command prefix is the default `!!` prefix that is set when the bot is added to a server. The `setprefix` command gives the option of changing the prefix, and if your server's prefix has been changed you should replace `!!` with that prefix.
