## **Step 1: Invite the Bot**
You can invite the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089&scope=bot&permissions=347200). All perrmissions listed are needed, misssing ones can make the bot not working as intended. If these permissions are not present some functions may not work. The bot can be invited to any server where you have the **Manage Server** permission.

## **Step 2: Start converting!**
You and your members can now use the [convert](all/convert.md) command to emojify your messages!
