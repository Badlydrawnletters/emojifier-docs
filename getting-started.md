## **Step 1: Invite the Bot**
You can invite the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=673994042450903089&scope=bot&permissions=347200). The bot needs all permissions shown in order to function correctly. If these permissions are not present some functions may not work. The bot can be invited to any server where you have the **Manage Server** permission.

## **Step 2: Get converting!**
You and your members can now use the [convert](all/convert.md) command to convert stuff.

?> If you have any issues configuring the bot, please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/MTwj6wG) to receive assistance!
