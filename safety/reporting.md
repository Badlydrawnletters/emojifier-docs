# How to Properly Report Issues to our Team
---
### What can be reported?
Any thing that violates Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines can be reported to our team! However if this if happening outside of our bot we are **unable** to take action on this, but Discord's Trust & Safety Team can handle this issue. Please report the user at [this](https://dis.gd/request) link and read [this](https://dis.gd/howtoreport) on how to report!
