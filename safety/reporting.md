### What can be reported?
Any thing that violates Discord's Terms of Service and/or Community Guidelines can be reported to our team! However if this is happening outside of our bot we are **unable** to take action on this, but Discord's Trust & Safety Team can handle this issue. Please report the user at [this](https://dis.gd/request) link and read [this](https://dis.gd/howtoreport) on how to report!
