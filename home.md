Emojifier, a Discord bot that focuses on enhancing a users chat experience. We have many commands to help make your chatting experience fun and enjoyable.

?> All **Usage** sections on these docs will assume that the command prefix is the default `!!` prefix that is set when the bot is added to a server. The `setprefix` command gives the option of changing the prefix, and if your server's prefix has been changed you should replace `!!` with that prefix.

?> In this documentation, arguments in <angle brackets> are required, while arguments in [brackets] are optional. You also should not type out the brackets and parenthesis when using the commands.
